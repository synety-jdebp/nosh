Troubleshooting
</h1>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey">
A service is continually switching between the "running" and "failed" states, and shows an uptime of 0 seconds (or 1 second).
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/daemontools-service-not-staying-up.html">
This service is failing to start properly; investigate its log and check its run script.</a>
</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey">
A service is stuck in the "starting", "failed", or "stopping" states.
</h2>

<p>
The <a href="service-control.html"><code>service-control</code> command</a> causes the service manager to send signals to the service process(es).
Those processes include the ones that run in the "starting", "failed", and "stopping" states &mdash; namely the <code>start</code>, <code>restart</code>, and <code>stop</code> programs and anything that they in their turn run.
So just terminate the process(es) with <code>service-control --terminate</code>.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that some "sysinit" services do things in their <code>start</code> programs that may take a long time.
The "fsck@" service <code>fsck</code>s a volume in its "starting" state, for example.
These long-running initialization actions are <em>not</em> necessarily stuck just because they take a long time.
</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey">
The system bootstrap never fully completes.
</h2>

<p>
Troubleshoot this by:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
&hellip; looking at the logs, if possible.
The system manager's own log output can be seen in <code>/run/system-manager/log/</code>.
</p>
<li><p>
&hellip; watching the bootstrap process interactively.
Start the system in rescue mode, then bring up the "normal" target interactively with:
<p>
<blockquote><pre>system-control start --verbose normal</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Watch for things that are "BLOCKED" and note how far through the boot process <code>system-control</code> gets.
</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<code>system-control</code> experiences a conflict
</h3>

<p>
The most common conflict is one between kernel virtual terminals and user-mode virtual terminals &mdash; the <code>ttylogin@ttyv1</code> service conflicting with the <code>console-fb-realizer@head0</code> service.
This is hard, but not impossible, to cause.
Simply disable the one or the other service.
</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
Volumes are not mounted, and services needing those volumes to be mounted cannot start
</h3>

<p>
The <code>mount@</code> services that mount volumes are not enabled in the base service bundles package.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, if you have your <code>/usr</code> and <code>/var</code> filesystems on separate volumes and you haven't enabled the <code>mount@-usr</code> and <code>mount@-var</code> services then many other services will fail not only to start but even to be found by the "normal" target when <code>system-control</code> goes looking for its dependencies.
</p>

<p>
You must enable these services.
This can be done explicitly, or by <a href="external-formats.html">the autoconfiguration system of <code>redo</code> scripts</a>, which will create and enable mount services based upon the contents of <code>/etc/fstab</code>.
</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
Services remain blocked
</h3>

<p>
In this scenario service A specifies that it is to be started after service B (or service B has specified that it is to start before service A), one or both services are directly or indirectly wanted by the "normal" target, and service B has failed to start.
</p>

<p>
Look at service B's own logs, and the output of
</p>
<blockquote><pre>system-control status B</pre></blockquote>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
The service manager reports errors when attempting to load a service
</h3>

<p>
The most common cause of this is that you have an enabled service whose <code>supervise</code> directory is on a read-only filesystem.
The service manager is thus unable to create/update the control/status API files in that directory.
</p>

<p>
Notice that "sysinit" services <a href="startup-and-shutdown.html#sysinit">locate their <code>supervise</code> directories under <code>/run/service-bundles/early-supervise/</code> for this very reason</a>.
The point where they are loaded by the service manager is well before the point that the <code>/var</code> or <code>/</code> volumes are mounted read-write.
</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px dotted grey">
<code>fsck</code> ran and then nothing else started
</h3>

<p>
The initial non-interactive <code>fsck</code> of mounted filesystems usually runs in "preen mode", which proceeds relatively quickly.
If, however filesystem tunable options cause a full <code>fsck</code> to run, <code>system-control</code> can sometimes time out waiting for the filesystem check services to finish.
This is because there's a time limit to how long <code>system-control</code> will attempt to bring the system up.
</p>

<p>
The limit is there so that a system that fails to fully come up <em>can be brought down</em>.
Without the time limit, the on-going attempts to bring the system up would defeat the process of trying to bring the system down, if an administrator chose to reboot.
And this is the remedial action to take here, in fact.
Simply reboot the system after all <code>fsck</code>s have successfully run, and the <code>monitor-fsck-progress</code> service has removed its user interface.
</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey">
An <code>/etc/fstab</code> entry is ignored.
</h2>

<p>
The conversion utility ignores entries that are not marked as <code>rw</code>, <code>rq</code>, <code>ro</code>, or <code>sw</code>.
Ensure that the entry is marked with a correct mount type.
</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey">
GNOME Terminal refuses to start.
</h2>

<p>
The GNOME Terminal command does little more than send its environment and arguments via the Desktop Bus to the <code>org.GNOME.Terminal</code> service.
Unfortunately, this service is excessively fussy and easy to break.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Despite the fact that it is supposed to be capable of talking to multiple X displays, and so should start up in a "not connected to any displays" mode initially, it actually attempts to connect to an X display at startup.
So not only must it have the <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable <a href="per-user-user-services.html#environment">set in its per-service environment</a>, that must denote a currently active X display that will accept cookie-less connections from the GNOME Terminal service.
</p><p>
This is just an outright bug.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The GNOME Terminal server requires that a UTF-8 locale be configured in its <code>LANG</code> environment variable, and refuses to start if it is not.
It cannot be just the <code>C</code> locale.
</p></li>
<li><p>
GNOME Terminal simply does not like some X servers, including the one in FreeBSD/TrueOS 11.
</p></li>
</ul>
